# Euler9_Python

Problem 9 of Project Euler solved in Python 3 using PyCharm. This program uses the quadratic equation approach to gererating Pythagorean Triples (see the comments on main.py for more information)

## Project Euler Problem 9 -- Special Pythagorean Triplet

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,

a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>

For example, 3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup> = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5<sup>2</sup>.

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
Find the product *abc*.
